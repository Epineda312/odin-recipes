A basic webpage of receipes. For this project I chose a few latin dishes I commonly prepare and enjoy. Here there are a total of 4 html files. The homepage linking to 3 others that each display 1 of the 3 recipes complete with images, a description of the dish, as well as a list of ingredients and steps for preparation.

        <p>
            Carne guisada is a beef stew that is native to many parts of Latin America. 
            It translates to “stewed meat”, and typically refer to tougher cuts of beef 
            that are cooked in a flavorful broth until it’s fork tender. The distinctive
             flavors of this Puerto Rican version comes from sofrito/recaito. Sofrito is
              a cooking base used in Puerto Rican cuisine. It’s a blend of vegetables 
              and herbs like garlic and recao (culantro) that gives every dish a punch 
              of distinctly Puerto Rican flavor.

            <li>10 pimento stuffed olives</li>
            <li>1 cup carrot, sliced into thick rings</li>
            <li>1 cup diced potatoes</li>
            <li>1-2 teaspoons red wine vinegar apple cider vinegar works too!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the beef cubes with 2 teaspoons of Adobo.</li>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven to medium heat, then add the olive oil.</li>
            <li>In 2-3 batches, sear the beef for 3-5 minutes per side, in order to get some nice browning on the outside.</li>
            <li>Once the beef is browned, remove from the pan and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and sofrito to the pan.</li>
            <li>Scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen the brown bits.</li>
            <li>Next, add the Sazon, powdered chicken bouillon, beef broth, red wine, tomato sauce, bay leaves and Italian seasoning.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then add the beef back in.</li>
            <li>Stir, then cover and reduce the heat to simmer. Cook the carne guisada for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Next, add the potatoes, carrots, and olives, then cook for 30 minutes more.</li>
            <li>When the carrots and potatoes are tender, the carne guisada is done.</li>
            <li>Stir in the vinegar, then check the stew for seasoning.</li>
            <li>If it needs more salt, add a little bit more powdered chicken bouillon (this stuff is super salty, so use sparingly).</li>
            <li>Serve with white rice, tostones and a salad.</li>
        </ol>
